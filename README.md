# DigitalLibraryBookManagementSystem

1.Firstly create 4 different packages for Model class,interface,Implementation,Main.
2.After that create Model class define the variables whicha are required for book and make them as private give control access by adding setters and getters it promotes the Encapsulation.
3.Create interface define what are the actions to be performed.
4.After that Create Implementation class by implementing the interface add the necessary logic to it.
5.After that create a Main class there to execution start by creating object of Implementation and calling the methods it promoted abstraction and also results to achieve standardisation.


Improvements
1.I thought that we can implement user login process and also update the status of book whenever book is given to the person.
2.If any reader wants any specific book then the librarian has to check available status of book to give.
3.To search specific book.
4.If we use database for to store books data it can be stored permanently.It helps for real time scenarios.
